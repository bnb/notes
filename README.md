# Notes

This is an experimental project for me, in which I'll be logging my experience at the Linux Foundation's Open-Source Leadership Summit in Markdown with the intent to publish it to dev.to as an article or set of articles. I may extend this as a longer-term thing if I like this approach. If I do, you'll only read this in the commit history. If I don't, you'll probably see this in the repo's README.md forever.

## What will I be writing

I'm not entirely sure yet. I plan to write down key points and notes from the talks I attend and the discussions I have, but... that may not manifest exactly as I imagine it. I may also just keep this semi-private forever if I don't write _enough_.

## When did you have this idea

After I got home from playing dungeons and dragons with friends the night before traveling to the Open-Source Leadership Summit, but before I started packing. Basically, writing this down is helping me procrastinate a tiny bit while still being productive.

## ... cool?
